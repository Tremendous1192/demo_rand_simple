# demo_rand_simple
[![Crate](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/rand_simple.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/rand_simple)
This repository is a demonstration of the rand_simple crate.

According to various documents, the data in dev-dependencies should not be compiled, but for some reason, the metadata size has increased. Therefore, I will separate the crate from the demonstration.

Plotting in Rust is challenging, so I am visualizing it using Python's Jupyter notebook.
